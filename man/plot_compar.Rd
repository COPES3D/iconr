\title{Plot and Save Comparison Figures Between Pairs of Graphs}
\description{
  Given a list of pairwise graph comparisons, the function plots any given subset selected by graph name, displaying side-by-side pairs of graphs and highlighting common nodes or common edges with a choice of several graphical parameters.
}
\usage{
  plot_compar(listg, graph2 = NULL, focus = "nodes",
              doss = getwd(),
              nd.color = c("orange", "red"), nd.size = c(0.5, 1),
              ed.color = c("orange", "red"), ed.width = c(1, 2),
              lbl.size = 0.5, img.format = "png", res = 300)
}
\arguments{
  \item{listg}{
      A list of graph pairwise comparisons returned by \code{\link[iconr]{list_compar}}.
  }
  \item{graph2}{
      A vector with the names of the graphs for which comparisons are to be plotted.
    The user can select to plot all pairwise combinations (by default), all combinations of a subset, or a single pair.
  }
  \item{focus}{
      Either \code{"nodes"} (default) or \code{"edges"}. It selects the type of comparison to be plotted, highlighting common nodes or common edges, respectively.
  }
  \item{doss}{
      The working directory containing the decoration images. The default is the current directory (\code{getwd()}).
  }
  \item{nd.color, nd.size, ed.color, ed.width}{
    Graphical parameters for color and size/widths of nodes and edges.
    Each of them is a vector with two values for different and common nodes/edges, respectively.
    If only one value is provided, this unique value is taken for both different and common elements.
    Labels are displayed with the same color as common nodes.
    For \code{focus = "nodes"} all edges are plotted with the first value of \code{ed.color} and \code{ed.width}.
  }
  \item{lbl.size}{
      Graphical parameter for the size of the labels with the node names. The default is 0.4.
  }
  \item{img.format, res}{
      Format and resolution of the saved images. The handled formats are \code{"png"} (default), \code{"bmp"}, \code{"tiff"}/\code{"tif"}, \code{"jpeg"}/\code{"jpg"}, and \code{"pdf"}.
      The default resolution is 300 (ppi). The resolution does not applies to format pdf.
  }
}
\details{
  To highlight common elements between a list of graphs, the user can focus on nodes \code{(focus = "nodes")} or edges \code{(focus = "edges")}. As stated in the function \code{\link[iconr]{list_compar}}, for a given comparison variable (eg. \code{nd.var="type"}) if there is multiple nodes/edges with the same value, it is considered to count for as many coincidences as the smaller multiplicity.
}
\value{
   Generates and save images in the indicated format for pairwise comparisons between two or more decorations, comparing graphs elements (nodes or edges). The return value is a character vector with the path/name of every saved image.
